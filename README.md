# NEEO - Driver Manager
NEEO Driver Manager provides a GUI interface to help install and manage NEEO Drivers.
***disclaimer*** I am yet to receive my NEEO devices so I have been unable to test properly. Also I don't own any of
the devices that the available drivers on npm communicate with. So a lot of testing is still required.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and run `npm run setup` to install dependencies for the server and client modules. You
can then spin up the GUI by using `npm start`

## Short Term Roadmap
- [ ] Feature - Driver Overview/Filtering By Status
- [ ] Feature - Start/Stop All Drivers
- [ ] Quality - Test With Actual NEEO Devices
- [ ] Quality - Code Linting
- [ ] Community - Production Builds
- [ ] Community - Easy Installation
- [ ] Community - Helpful README
- [ ] Community - Git Commit Validation
- [ ] Community - PR Template

## Longer Term Roadmap
- [ ] Feature - Driver Development Sandbox
- [ ] Feature - Install Drivers via NEEO Remote (do-able?)
- [ ] Feature - Google Assistant Integration (using this app as a bridge)
